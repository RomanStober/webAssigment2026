        <h2>Personal goals and projects</h2>
        <p>Some of my personal carrer goals are to get a job in a tech field doing something I love so it feels like im not even working a job</p>
        <P>I hope to land an internship this summer so I can get my foot in the door in tech companies or companies that need a tech role filled.</P> 
        <p>Another personal goal of mine is to give back to my parents as much as possible with the job that I do land, I want to be able to buy them nice trips and personal gifts that mean something to them like they do to me.</p>
